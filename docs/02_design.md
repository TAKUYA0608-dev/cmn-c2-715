# Template Design Specification — CMN-C2-715

LLM Fine-Tuning Data Governance Q&A (APPI 2026 + EU AI Act Art.10) — Cat 2, GraphNode-in-main.

## Position in AgentCore Architecture

- **Agent Class**: `LLMFineTuningGovernanceQaAgent` (module-level alias of `Graph`)
- **L1 Base**: AgentBaseGraph (L1 direct — Cat 2 GraphNode-in-main; **not** AutonomousBaseGraph)
- **Category**: Cat 2 — orchestrates a fixed multi-step compliance-advisory workflow to produce one
  job-to-be-done deliverable (a fine-tuning data-governance compliance checklist + dataset audit trail, cited
  to public-law articles). `DocGenerationAgent` is a pattern reference only (L2 deprecation 2026-05-18).
- **Three-Layer Separation**:
  - State: flat TypedDict composition (no Pydantic — msgpack incompatible); complex fields are JSON strings (ADR-005)
  - Node: L1 inheritance (Template Method: `execute(self, state: dict) -> dict` override only — no `config` param)
  - Graph: composition (`register_nodes()` for node substitution; domain complexity behind a `GraphNode`)

## Architecture Overview

### Node Configuration (outer 5-slot backbone)

| Node | Responsibility | Input State | Output State | Inherits/Overrides |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| initialize | schema/session/trust setup | user_input | caller_trust_level, session_id | InitializeNode (default) |
| pre_process | `QueryNormalize` — S-1/S-2 validation, NFKC, size cap, injection→degraded, field-level input hygiene (credential/My-Number/email/phone redaction on **every** supplied free-text field — query + dataset descriptors; **dataset `dataset_id`/`id` UNCONDITIONALLY privacy-tokenized to `ds:<sha8>` — no syntactic passthrough, a bare name is opaque like any value**; **provenance `source` resolved to a citation ONLY if it names an authorized data-governance system of record (privacy-tokenized `src:<sha8>`), else dropped to `None`** — S-3 then blocks); legal-domain classification (APPI / EU_AI_ACT / JAPAN_AI_ACT / NIST) + slot extraction | user_input | validated_input, input_format, enriched_context, (error_code) | PreProcessNode (FunctionNode) |
| main | `GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflowGraphNode` — wraps inner `GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflow` (composition criterion #9) | validated_input | result, retrieval_hit_count, (error_code), status | GraphNode (subgraph) |
| post_process | `ResponseValidate` — S-3 output gate: **fail-closed citation completeness** (a grounded advisory whose statutory citations are missing, or whose supplied datasets do not all carry resolved provenance → `needs_review` degrade, deliverable body withheld, `error_code=CITATION_INCOMPLETE`) + credential/My-Number/email/phone re-redaction + DRAFT "confirm with legal/DPO" disclaimer, S-4 audit | result | formatted_output, disclaimer, audit_logged, (error_code) | PostProcessNode (FunctionNode) |
| finalize | build response envelope | formatted_output | output, status | FinalizeNode (default) |

### Inner workflow (`src/graph/domain_workflow_graph.py` — BaseGraph, linear + per-node skip guard)

```
START → hybrid_retrieve → clause_mapping → governance_eval → END
```

| Inner Node | Responsibility | Skip guard |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| hybrid_retrieve | Deterministic BM25-lite retrieval over the seeded governance KB (APPI 2026 / EU AI Act Art.10 / Japan AI Act Ch.III-IV / NIST AI RMF — all public-law sources). Set `retrieval_hit_count`. **0 clauses matched (rejected input or out-of-domain query) → `error_code=NO_CLAUSE` → out-of-scope safe answer** | — (first node; emits `.skip` on rejected/no-match input) |
| clause_mapping | Deterministic mapping of each retrieved clause to the caller context (jurisdictions / training_technique / data_types) → per-obligation applicability annotation | no-op `return {}` (after `.skip` emit) on `error_code` / `retrieval_hit_count == 0` |
| governance_eval | Compose the deliverable: a compliance checklist (per obligation — requirement + recommended action + audit step, cited to law+article) + a dataset audit trail (per supplied dataset — opaque `ds:<sha8>` + provenance status) + confidence + summary. On 0-hit/rejected → out-of-scope safe answer | emits safe answer on `error_code` / no clauses |

> **Conditional edges do not propagate across the subgraph boundary** (GraphNode wraps the inner graph),
> so the inner topology is a **static linear backbone with per-node skip guards** — the portable Cat 2 form
> shipped across the fleet. `add_conditional_edges` is intentionally **not** used inside the subgraph.

### Data Flow

```
START → initialize → pre_process → main(GraphNode) → {route} → post_process → finalize → END
                                        ↓ (retry, max 3)
                                     pre_process
```

**Degraded / rejected path (mandatory contract).** An injection marker, an oversize payload, empty input,
or zero matched governance clauses never sets `status=ERROR`. Instead the node returns `status=SUCCESS`
**plus an `error_code`** (`INJECTION_REJECTED` / `INPUT_TOO_LONG` / `INPUT_REJECTED` / `NO_CLAUSE`). This is
deliberate: in the production framework `status=ERROR` short-circuits `AgentBaseGraph.route()` straight to
`finalize`, so **`main`/`post_process` would be skipped and the mandatory DRAFT disclaimer + S-3 redaction
+ S-4 terminal audit would never run**. With `SUCCESS + error_code`, `route()` reaches `post_process`,
which always emits the out-of-scope safe answer, disclaimer, and audit. On the injection/oversize path
`pre_process` **discards the offending body** (`validated_input="{}"`, `user_input` cleared) so no rejected
content is ever processed. Because `GraphNode.extract_input()` passes only `validated_input` into the fresh
inner state, `merge_output` surfaces the **outer** `error_code` first (`state.get("error_code") or
sub_result.get("error_code")`) so a pre-stage rejection code survives to the terminal S-4 audit.

### State Definition (`src/schemas/state.py`)

| Field | Type | Purpose | Required |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| validated_input | NotRequired[str] | JSON `{query, datasets[], training_technique, jurisdictions, query_domain}` from pre_process (credential/My-Number redacted; dataset ids tokenized; provenance resolved) | no |
| input_format | NotRequired[str] | `json` / `text` / `empty` / `rejected` | no |
| enriched_context | NotRequired[str] | JSON `{source, channel}` (read-only caller context) | no |
| masked_request_fields | NotRequired[str] | JSON list of the request field names (`query` / `jurisdictions` / `training_technique`) that reached pre_process as `[MASKED]` — names only, never values | no |
| retrieved_clauses | NotRequired[str] | JSON retrieved governance clauses (clause_id, law, article, citation, requirement, …) | no |
| retrieval_hit_count | NotRequired[int] | clauses matched (0 → out-of-scope safe answer) | no |
| mapped_obligations | NotRequired[str] | JSON per-clause applicability annotation vs caller context | no |
| result | NotRequired[str] | JSON assembled governance-advisory deliverable (checklist + dataset audit trail) | no |
| formatted_output | NotRequired[str] | JSON final response envelope (deliverable + disclaimer) | no |
| disclaimer | NotRequired[str] | mandatory DRAFT "confirm with legal / DPO" disclaimer | no |
| audit_logged | NotRequired[bool] | True once terminal audit event emitted | no |
| error_code | NotRequired[str] | `INPUT_REJECTED` / `INJECTION_REJECTED` / `INPUT_TOO_LONG` / `NO_CLAUSE` / `CITATION_INCOMPLETE` | no |
| error_message | NotRequired[str] | operator-facing detail | no |

**State Constraints (mandatory):**
- Flat TypedDict only (primitives + JSON-serializable types); complex fields serialized as JSON strings (ADR-005)
- No JWT, API keys, credentials in State (checkpoint DB leakage) — pre_process input hygiene redacts them from
  **every** supplied free-text field (query + dataset descriptors)
- **Opaque-id boundary — privacy tokenize vs provenance validation are SEPARATE (primary defense = input side).**
  - **Privacy (identifiers).** A dataset `dataset_id`/`id` is **unconditionally** tokenized to `ds:<sha8>` —
    there is NO syntactic "this looks like a safe id" passthrough (a name such as `Alice` / `John.Smith` /
    `TaroYamada` with no spaces/symbols is tokenized like any other value). Tokenizing hides PII; it makes
    **no** claim that the value is authorized.
  - **Provenance (citations).** A caller `source` becomes a grounded citation **only when it resolves to an
    authorized data-governance system of record** (`AUTHORIZED_PROVENANCE_SYSTEMS`, the deploying org's / CoE's
    trusted-context registry — a *semantic* allowlist of authorized systems, not a character class). Then it
    is privacy-tokenized to `src:<sha8>` (raw label never verbatim). Any other value — a dataset name,
    `unknown`, a fabricated string, **or a value that merely looks like a surrogate (`src:1a2b3c4d`)** — is
    **not** verifiable provenance → `None` → S-3 blocks the per-dataset audit trail as `CITATION_INCOMPLETE`
    (fail-closed). "Tokenized" is never sufficient for a citation. No synthetic provenance is fabricated.
  - Provenance is resolved **exactly once** (S-1 / pre_process); the inner workflow trusts that resolved value
    verbatim and never re-resolves (re-resolving an internal `src:<sha8>` would, correctly, reject it), so a
    forged surrogate can never imitate an internal one downstream.
- InvocationContext via `config["configurable"]` only (not in State)
- No Pydantic models, dataclass, arbitrary Python objects (msgpack incompatible)

## Framework Utilization

### Shared Components Used
- [x] InvocationContext (correlation_id, session_id, caller_trust_level) — read-only inside nodes
- [x] **S-2**: `_extra_security_gate_input(self, state) -> dict` on `PreProcessNode` — size cap +
      prompt-injection markers + field-level input hygiene. SDK 1.0.0 contract: **MUST NOT raise, and MUST
      NOT return `status=ERROR`**. A rejection is surfaced as a **degraded `SUCCESS + error_code`**
      (`INJECTION_REJECTED` / `INPUT_TOO_LONG`); `pre_process.execute()` re-checks the same conditions
      (the `@final` hook is not invoked by the local stub framework) and discards the offending body so the
      pipeline reaches `post_process` and always emits the disclaimer + audit. **MUST NOT override
      `_security_gate_input()`** — `TypeError` at class definition.
- [x] **S-3**: `PostProcessNode.execute()` enforces **fail-closed citation completeness** — a grounded
      advisory (`status_kind == "governance_advisory"`) with no statutory citations, or with any supplied
      dataset whose provenance did not resolve, is not presented; it degrades to a safe `needs_review` answer
      (deliverable body withheld, `error_code=CITATION_INCOMPLETE`, still SUCCESS so the disclaimer + S-4 audit
      run). Statutory citations come only from the KB (never fabricated); dataset provenance is an allowlisted
      opaque reference validated once in pre_process. A whole-report redactor re-redacts credential / My-Number
      / email / phone leakage. `_extra_security_gate_output(self, result) -> dict` additionally verifies the
      mandatory DRAFT disclaimer is present and MAY raise to block. **MUST NOT override
      `_security_gate_output()`** — `TypeError` at class definition.
- [x] **S-4**: `emit_trace_event()` inside **every** `execute()` path (including skip / safe branches) —
      domain event only (never `node_start`/`node_complete` which `BaseNode.__call__()` emits automatically).
      Counts / query domain / error_code only — never the raw caller query, a dataset name, or provenance.

> **S-2/S-3 gate behaviour by node type (ADR-017):**
> - `FunctionNode` subclass (`PreProcessNode`, `PostProcessNode`, and the three inner nodes) → framework
>   `@final` gate always runs automatically; extend via `_extra_security_gate_input()` / `_extra_security_gate_output()` only.
> - `GraphNode` (`GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflowGraphNode`) → deliberate no-op (the wrapped subgraph nodes' gates already apply).

### Trust Level (S-1)
All concrete `FunctionNode` subclasses declare `required_trust_level = TrustLevel.VERIFIED_EXTERNAL`
explicitly (gate-trust-level-check), matching the agent-level `required_trust_level` in `config/agent.yaml`.
`GraphNode` is excluded by design (delegated S-1).

### Determinism (no LLM)
The template is **fully deterministic** — no LLM is used. Legal-domain classification, BM25-lite clause
retrieval, clause-to-context mapping, and checklist / audit-trail synthesis are pure tokenization + keyed KB
composition (the governance KB in `src/services/service.py`), so every answer is reproducible, auditable, and
grounded in a cited public-law article. `config/agent.yaml` declares no model and `pyproject.toml` declares no
LLM dependency. The agent answers governance *questions* only — it never ingests or processes fine-tuning
training data itself (APPI compliance by architecture).

### Platform masking of request terms (S-2)
The platform's personal-data pass runs before this template and replaces any run of two or more Title-Case
words in the request with `[MASKED]`; the template cannot switch it off. Measured on AgentCore 1.0.3: "EU AI Act
Article 10" reaches retrieval as "EU AI [MASKED] 10" (the Art.10(2) and Art.10(5) obligations are then not
retrieved), "Personal Information Protection Commission" and "United States" become `[MASKED]`, and a
`training_technique` of "Supervised Fine-Tuning" becomes "[MASKED]-Tuning" and no longer normalises. pre_process
records which request fields (`query` / `jurisdictions` / `training_technique`) contain the token in
`masked_request_fields` — a masked `training_technique` that still normalises ("[MASKED]-Tuning (SFT)" → `sft`)
is not listed; post_process then adds the stable code `QUERY_TERMS_MASKED` to the envelope's
`limitations` list (codes only; `[]` when nothing was masked), sets `confidence: "low"`, and appends to `message`
which fields were masked and how to rephrase. When a masked request retrieves nothing, `status_kind` is
`not_evaluated` instead of `out_of_scope`: nothing matching a partly erased question is not evidence that it is
outside the KB. The trade-off is that an off-topic question containing a masked name is also `not_evaluated`.

### Human decision boundary (advisory-only, no HumanApprovalGate node)
This template is **advisory-only**: it composes a DRAFT compliance checklist + audit trail and never files, an
application, edits a dataset, or renders a binding legal determination. There is **no `human_gate` node** in
the inner workflow; the human decision boundary is enforced at output by the **mandatory DRAFT disclaimer**
("this is a draft — the final compliance judgement and any filing are the responsibility of an authorized
legal / DPO reviewer"). The S-3 gate blocks any output missing that disclaimer.

### Composition Pattern
- **Pattern**: GraphNode (subgraph) — outer `AgentBaseGraph` 5-slot backbone with a `GraphNode` in the `main`
  slot wrapping an inner `BaseGraph` (`GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflow`).
- **Composition target**: `src/graph/domain_workflow_graph.py::GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflow`
- **Subgraph caching**: `get_subgraph()` caches the inner graph on the **class attribute** (`GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflowGraphNode._subgraph`, not `self` — avoids mutable node-instance state per §9; built once).
- **Error propagation strategy**: `propagate` — an inner ERROR surfaces as `SubgraphError`; the deterministic
  degraded path (0-clause / rejected) instead returns `status = SUCCESS + error_code` and a safe answer.

## Import Isolation Confirmation
- [x] Template does not import agenticstar-platform SDK (Level 0) — PB-4
- [x] Import targets: `framework/` and `shared/` only (via `src.utils.audit` fallback shim)

## Design Decision Record

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| L1 base type | **AgentBaseGraph** | AutonomousBaseGraph | **AgentBaseGraph** | Fixed multi-step workflow, no autonomous reasoning loop — Cat 2 |
| Composition pattern | FunctionNode-in-main (Cat 1) | **GraphNode-in-main (Cat 2)** | **GraphNode-in-main** | Domain workflow has ≥3 ordered steps → encapsulate behind a subgraph |
| Inner topology | conditional edges | **linear + skip guards** | **linear + skip guards** | Conditional edges do not propagate across the subgraph boundary |
| Retrieval / synthesis | LLM narrative | **deterministic BM25-lite + keyed KB composition** | **deterministic** | Auditable, reproducible; grounded in cited public-law articles — see Determinism |
| Human sign-off | agent renders a binding determination | **advisory-only DRAFT disclaimer** | **advisory-only DRAFT disclaimer** | The final compliance judgement / filing is a human legal / DPO reviewer's, never the agent's |
| Degraded path | status=ERROR | **status=SUCCESS + error_code** | **SUCCESS + error_code** | ERROR would skip post_process (S-3/S-4) in production FW |

## Open Items (deferred to Stage ③ Implementation MR)
- Node `execute()` bodies (`hybrid_retrieve`, `clause_mapping`, `governance_eval`, rewritten `pre_process` /
  `post_process`), the inner `GovernanceAdvisoryWorkflow`, `FineTuningGovernanceService` (governance KB +
  BM25-lite retrieval + `safe_identifier` + `resolve_provenance` + checklist/audit-trail synthesis),
  `src/utils/audit.py` (S-4 shim), unit / integration / boundary tests, and docs/03 + docs/07 land in the
  Stage ③ implementation MR. This design MR ships `docs/02_design.md` + `src/schemas/state.py` only.
